# Maze-Project
 Problem Definition 	-Given a starting point in an 8x12 maze, find the cheese, then an exit point, printing the maze showing the shortest path found
//I - User must input the complete file directory of their maze 
//O - Outputs include the initial maze, updated mazes with paths to the cheese and exit, and a coordinate based solution to the maze
//P - Processes include recursive navigation from the start point to the cheese and from the cheese to the exit, 
//    as well as other functions processing relevant information, ex. number of moves, shortest path
